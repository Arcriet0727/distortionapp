# Relativistic Distortion App
Here is the demo version of the Relativistic Distortion App.

Instructions:
This version is only suitable for landscape mode turned to the left, i.e., rotating the mobile screen to the left while in portrait mode. Before using, please ensure you are in an outdoor location with good GPS signal. The website will request access to the camera when it starts running. After granting permission, click on the webpage to activate the GPS and gyroscope features.

iOS users can use it normally. If you are an Android user, please face due north when starting the app.

The slider in the top-left corner allows you to set the speed of light to achieve the desired distortion effect.

This demo version will be updated periodically.

Log:
9/21/2023: Applied shader for the video stream and transformed the code to the landscape mode. Fixed the 0 speed and heading bug.
