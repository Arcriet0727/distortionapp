This is Dynamic App! Please ensure that you are in an area with good GPS signal when running this program. If you are Android user, please face to the north when you start the program. 
The program carries out coordinate transformations based on gyroscope and GPS data, ensuring that the speed vector direction on the screen always points to the actual direction of movement in real space, and associates it with the displacement and scaling of the Lookalike Sphere.

Some issues: It seems necessary to set a value for the GPS data when stationary; otherwise, the program might not display the image. Need to find an approach for Android user to access the compass function.
